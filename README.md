## üìå Overview

**OCTO CyberSim** is a **Telegram-based network simulation tool** designed to demonstrate how various network-layer and application-layer denial techniques function in real-time. It allows authorized red teamers, researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to understand how different forms of traffic manipulation can affect system behavior ‚Äî all controlled via a Telegram bot.

## üéÆ Features

- üéõÔ∏è **Interactive Bot Interface** ‚Äî Controlled entirely via Telegram inline menus.
- üåê **Supports Multiple Attack Simulations:**
  - `SYN Flood` (TCP exhaustion)
  - `UDP Amplification` (simulated bandwidth surge)
  - `Slowloris` (HTTP starvation)
  - `ICMP Ping Flood` (layer 3 simulation)
  - `NXDOMAIN Attack` (DNS overload)
  - `WebSocket Flood` (layer 7 abuse)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Multi-threaded Execution** for realism.
- üß† Built-in IP resolution and spoofed interaction modes.
